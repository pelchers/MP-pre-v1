confirm our goals and finally we then can start with the simple version page setup for the primary 1 page full scope design based on the files in our @ai-docs folder @cursor-instructions.md @simple-version.md @simple-project.md @cursor-rules.md

## Project Goals Confirmation

Based on the files in your ai-docs folder, I understand your goals are to create:

1. A **simple, single-page vertical-scroll marketing site** with:
   - Minimal horizontal scroll sections
   - Campaign-specific Tailwind base styles
   - Content that fully reflects a marketing plan structure

2. You want to implement this using:
   - **Frontend:** Vite + React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + ShadCN UI
   - **No backend** for the simple version (static content)
   - Optional local JSON file for stats, features, or timeline data

3. The site should be structured to match your marketing plan sections:
   - Executive Summary
   - Mission Statement
   - Marketing Objectives
   - SWOT Analysis
   - Market Research
   - Strategy
   - Execution Plan
   - Budget
   - Conclusion

4. You want to be able to create new campaigns by copying the base version and modifying the content directly in the files.

## Next Steps

Would you like me to help you set up the simple version of your marketing site based on these goals? I can help with:

1. Setting up the Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind project
2. Creating the folder structure
3. Building the main campaign page with all the marketing plan sections
4. Implementing the styling based on your style guide
5. Setting up the JSON data structure (if needed)

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
